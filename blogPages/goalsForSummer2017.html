    	<h1>Goals for Summer 2017</h1>
    	<p class="date">May 22, 2017</p>
    	<p>Last summer, I had an interest in learning about mobile app development, which I spent the entire break to learn about for both iOS and Android devices. Now, with the end of the spring semester, I want to spend my free time to learn something new.</p>
      <p>Something I’ve always found interesting and what I aim for as a career path is Artificial Intelligence. As a huge Sci-fi fan, watching movies and playing video games where there were androids that seemed alive was always more than just an awesome fantasy idea. It is a future reality that I’d love to be a part of one day since now we are getting closer to it with all the machines and robots that are completing tasks thanks to machine learning.</p>
      <p>Over the summer, my goal is to study about machine learning and how to program it using tools and algorithms. In the past, I’ve worked with 3rd party web services that offered machine learning, which helped me understand some basic concepts. I already know python, and I plan to learn R since both languages are used heavily in statistical programming.</p>
      <p>While learning about machine learning in my free time, I was able to score an internship in data analytics which deals with data science. I hope to learn a lot from this since machine learning involves data science, and I plan on reading many books to get a better understanding in the field.</p>
      <p>I have other big plans for summer that I may post later on once I get certain things confirmed, but overall, this is looking to be a very busy summer that could be the bases for what I’ll do in the future.</p>
